    "# Data Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading Cyber SBOM Data into Neo4j\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that you have loaded the [Cyber VPEM use case data](https://github.com/pedroleitao-neo4j/cyber-vpem) into Neo4j. This notebook loads additional data required for the **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** use case, specifically focusing on **transitive dependencies** and software lineage within the supply chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transitive Dependency Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "A transitive dependency occurs when your application relies on a library, which in turn relies on another library. This creates a \"hidden\" attack surface where vulnerabilities can exist multiple layers deep in your software stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, we simulate a supply chain \"poisoning\" event:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deep Vulnerability:** A critical CVE is identified in a low-level open-source component (e.g., `vulnerable-codec`).\n",
    "2. **Shared Usage:** This component is a dependency for a widely used internal \"Core Utility\" library (`common-utils`).\n",
    "3. **Silent Propagation:** Multiple business applications (e.g., `CustomerFacingAPI`, `LegacyParser`) include the utility library, unknowingly inheriting the high-risk vulnerability.\n",
    "4. **Operational Risk:** By connecting this code lineage to infrastructure data, we identify that this \"hidden\" bug is actually running on an internet-facing production server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synthetic Data Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this scenario, we leverage the existing `DEPENDENCY_OF` relationship to create recursive chains. While traditional flat SBOMs (like spreadsheets) show a list of files, the graph reveals the **functional hierarchy** of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data loading method `create_sbom_scenario_data()` performs the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dependency Chain:** Establishes `DEPENDENCY_OF` relationships from a third-party library to a shared internal library, and finally to existing `BuildArtifact` nodes.\n",
    "* **Vulnerability Mapping:** Links a critical **CVE** node (such as Log4j) directly to the deep-seated transitive library.\n",
    "* **Environment Context:** Utilizes the existing schema to trace the code from the `Library` node up through the `Application` and onto the `ComputeInstance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By modeling the software supply chain as a **Security Knowledge Graph**, defenders can achieve **Code-to-Cloud traceability**, instantly identifying every running instance affected by a newly discovered zero-day vulnerability."
